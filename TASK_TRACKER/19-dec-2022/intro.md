ROUTING IN REACT
1- WHY WE NEED ROUTING?

THERE ARE SEVERAL SCREENS, THAT WE CANNOT SHOW TO USER AT A TIME.
SO WE NEED SOME LOGIC, SO SHOW SPECIFIC ON SPECFIC TIME

<Link >

useNavigation()



clickHandler (){
    ccs
    dw

    dwdw
    useNavigate("/")
}



<buttton> CLICK ME <>

react-router


useParam(${id})

dynamic()


<Link> => direct redirect to the given url
useNaviagate() => for the static url + business logic
useParams() => for the dynamic url
