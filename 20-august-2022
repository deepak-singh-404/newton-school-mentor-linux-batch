1- Declare variable

===============
Java is strong typed language
 Whenever we declare varible, we have to mention data typed


Javascript is loosely typed
let, var, const

var a = 10
var a = "10"
var a = "papa"
its datetype get updated in the run time.
You dont have to mention datatype of varibale, at the time varible initialize.
