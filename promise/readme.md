//Sync vs aysnc

javascript is

1- Synchronous
2- Single theaded
3- Blocking


1- sycn function1
2- sync function2
3- sync function3

4- async function
5- 


sync => js engine will try to execute at that instance => once done => then only it will go for the next task.
asyc => js engine will put this in call stack => and without waiting for result => it will go for the next task.
